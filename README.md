# Gumroad Frontend Challenge


## To run
1. Download or clone this repo
2. Copy `index.html`'s absloute path
3. Paste absloute path in browser
4. Comment in/out `<script src="js/gumroad.js"></script>` or `<script src="js/gumroad-embed.js"></script>` respectively to
see how each one behaves
   - Currently, only one appears if both are commented-in in `index.html`, I'm not exactly sure why that happens, to be honest, but I just wanted to let you know that I'm aware of that issue

## Other notes
To use absloute imports (e.g. `src="https://some-hosting-site.com/js/gumroad-embed.js"` or `src="https://some-hosting-site.com/js/gumroad.js"`), the JavaScript directory must be hosted (e.g. on `some-hosting-site.com`)
