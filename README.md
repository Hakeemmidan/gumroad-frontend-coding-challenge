# Hi

Feel free to comment-in the `<script src="js/gumroad.js"></script>` tag in `index.html`,
and comment-out `<script src="js/gumroad-embed.js"></script>` to see how it looks.


For the script links, instead of a relative import, this could be hosted, and use an absloute import in production (e.g. `src="https://some-hosting-site/js/gumroad-embed.js"` or `src="https://some-hosting-site/js/gumroad.js"`)
